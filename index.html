            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Abigail Agarin. I have lived both in the North and West though I'm currently based in Lagos.
                Some of my favorite things to do are <em>read, listen to music, play games.</em>
                These are activities that I enjoy immensely and indulge in daily.
            </p>
            <p>My career aspiration is to become an expert in software development, to be the architect of the solution. 
                The person who thinks up the total solution and all the connecting pieces more like the <strong>The Grand Wizard...lol</strong>

            <p>I have been told that I am a charming, kind, attitude-prone 
            person with "oddities" and could be very blunt sometimes. 
            I look up mostly to my family members, especially
            my parents, as a guiding figure in life.
